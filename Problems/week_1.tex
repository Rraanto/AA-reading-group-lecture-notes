\begin{boxedProblem}[2.1.7]
let $S$ be any set. Prove that the law of composition defined by $ab = a$ is associative.
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.2.15]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[]
        \item
    In the definition of subgroup, the identity element in $H$ is required to be the identity of $G$. One might require only that $H$ have an identity element, not that it is the same as the identity in $G$. Show that if $H$ has an identity at all, then it is the identity of $G$, so this definition would be equivalent to the one given.
    \item Show the analogous thing for inverses
    \end{enumerate}

\end{boxedProblem}


\begin{boxedProblem}[2.1.5]
    Assume that the equation $xyz = 1$ holds in a group $G$. Does it follow that $yzx = 1$? That $yxz = 1$?
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.2.20]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[]
    \item Let $a, b$ be elements of an abelian group of orders $m, n$ respectively. What can you say about the order of their product $ab$?
    \item (*) Show by example that the product of elements of finite order in a nonabelian group need not have finite order.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.2.1]
    Determine the elements of the cyclic group generated by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.4.6]
    Let $f:\R^* \longrightarrow \C^\times$ be the map $f(x) = e^{ix}$. Prove that $f$ is a homomorphism and determine its kernel and image.
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.3.11]
    Prove that the set $Aut(G)$ of automorphisms of a group $G$ forms a group, the law of composition being composition of functions.
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.3.12]
    Let $G$ be a group, and let $\varphi:G \longrightarrow G$ be the map $\varphi(x) = x^{-1}$.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that $\varphi$ is bijective.
    \item Prove that $\varphi$ is an automorphism if and only if $G$ is abelian.
\end{enumerate}
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.4.11]
    let $G, H$ be cyclic groups, generated by elements $x, y$. Determine the condition on the orders $m, n$ of $x$ and $y$ so that the map sending $x^i \longmapsto y^i$ is a group homomorphism.
\end{boxedProblem}

\begin{boxedProblem}[2.4.3]
    Prove that the kernel and image of a homomorphism are subgroups.
\end{boxedProblem}
